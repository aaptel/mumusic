     ...or mu-archive or mumusic or whatever
             haven't decided yet...


# Why

- keep traces of the music made by mutants
- archive all bandcamp threads for later viewing
- might handle soundcloud or <other website> at some point

# How

- the site is made for google appengine
- written for the python 2.7 runtime
- fetch threads on /mu/ every 30mn
- keep the ones detected as bandcamp threads

# Implementation

- `model.py`: db model, very dumb (and pretty slow)
- `board.py`: board/thread/post manipulation
- `mumusic.py`: page routes, update procedure, etc
- `template/`: html templates
- `lib/`: python dependencies
- `archive.py`: independant script to backup /mu/ to pickle/JSON.
